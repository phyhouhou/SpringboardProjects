# Topic Modeling and Machine Learning on Hotel Review Data

The purpose of the capstone project is to anlyze what customers are talking about a hotel and predict how well they think of a hotel based on what they say about it.

* 2ndCapstoneProjec_FinalReport.md summarizes our analysis including data scraping, cleaning and wrangling and exploratory data analysis. This project implements topic modeling on hotel reviews data aiming to extract what customers are talking about a hotel. It also builds machine learning models for predicting how well reviewers score a hotel. 

* Capstone2_slides.pdf is the presentation. 

* SecondCapstoneProject_NLP_ML.ipynb is the notebook where we carry out the NLP analysis and topic modeling process and develop machine learning models for prediciton.<br>
