# Project: Heights and Weights Using Logistic Regression

This mini project builds logistic regression models to predict gender of people, i.e., 'male' or 'female' from their height and weight data. Cross-validation (k-fold and GridSearchCV) is implemented to improve the model's performance. Details can be found in the .ipynb file.
